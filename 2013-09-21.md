Week 3:

  I enjoyed listening to the amazing guest lectures that came in to share their research this week. On Tuesday, Eric Barlow talked about his work studying toads at Yosemite National Park. He was able to accurately predict toads throughout the park based about previous data. Although predicting the presence of toads does not seem very spectacular at first, Eric explained how toads can signify habitat health. He and his fellow researchers spent much time gathering data to finally be able to predict the presence of toads. Although his data is specific to Yosemite National Park, his process can be made universal so that other researchers can asses the habit health of other parks. His presentation was an example of the usefulness of collaborative data science, the core subject of this class. I hope to learn more about how he analyzed his data so we can apply it to our own studies. 
  
  On Thursday, Philip Stark came in to speak about predicting earthquakes from rainfall data, the overall goal of this class. He gave us background info about the data that has been provided and the setbacks we are likely to encounter. His presentation was very practical because he discussed different statistical tests that can be used to analyze the data and the shortcomings of each one. I liked the fact that I now have a better idea of the goal of this class and the approaches we are going to use to get there. I hope to start using new programming software and analyzing real data soon!
