###Week 9:

This week I got a better understanding of the final goal of the earthquake project and my individual role in reaching that goal. On Tuesday, Aaron discussed the overall goals of the data curators, analyzers, visualizers, and presenters. Last Sunday I was unable to come to office hours with the rest of my data curator group because of other commitments so I was worried that I wouldn't have anything to contribute. Luckily, there was still work to be done and Tristan was nice enough to get me up to speed. During office hours, Jie was able to extract all the SCEC earthquake data from 1938-2013. The files were all called ".catalog" so we weren't sure how to open them but Tristan wrote code to convert all the files into .csv format. After running the code, I saw that there were 76 individual csv files from 1938 to 2013 so I decided it may be beneficial to combine the csv files into one big csv file. I knew I could accomplish this easily in MATLAB or r but I was still not completely familiar with python syntax so I had to do some reading about python. In the end, I realized that python syntax is actually pretty simple and similar to the programming languages I know. Theresa then did some research and was able to figure out what each of the column names mean. This was very useful because now the analyzers can make sense of the data we extracted. By Thurday the data curator group defnitely made significant progress but there was still some big questions left to answer. 

On Thursday, Aaron divided the class into their individual horizontal groups to discuss road blocks and goals. Our group's main objectives for next Tuesday include cleaning up the data we have by removing NA's and possibly cleaning up the data column, transforming the huge csv file into a google spreadsheet so that anyone can access the cached data without running our code first, and also figuring out the scope of the project. I personally think it would be wise to concentrate solely on Southern California earthquake data because that is already plenty of information. It would difficult to get earthquake data from all over the world because there are so many sources out there. In addition, since we are time restricted, it makes more sense to focus on one area first, see if the analyzers are able to create a model for that data and then provide more data if they are successful.

Since we had to get into smaller groups, the data curator group split into two groups with a presentor in each group. My subgroup is focusing on cleaning up the data and figuring out the scope. We are going to office hours today to see if Aaron can give us more insight into what are next steps should be.
