####Week 6:

On Tuesday, each group presented their questionnaire analysis. It was interesting to see how each group interpreted the assignment differently. We were all given the same homework instructions but we all approached the data in a unique way. Our group chose to use R to clean up and analyze the data because none of us had any experience using python. However, I was surprised by how many groups managed to use python to look at their data. Everyone came up with unique graphs that all led to the same result which was good. It was surprising to me that some of the most simple graphs were the mmost informative. For example the word cloud illustrating student's experience with various programming languages was so simple yet informative. By looking at other groups' presentations, I learned about what my group can improve upon next time and what we did well.

On Thursday, we spent the majority of the class discussing the reproducibility of each project and the plus's and deltas of our individual group. After being unable to reproduce even one group's code, the importance of reproducibility became important. I realized just how difficult it is to provide instructions for your work because of the assumptions you make. After working with R for so long, it seemed obvious how to install R and read the questionnaire data into a csv file. However, after receiving issues about how to download r and the csv file, our group realized that we definitely have to be clearer about our instructions and be conscious of every assumption we make. Similarly, we had trouble running other groups code because of the assumptions they made. 

I think it was beneficial to discuss the positives and negatives of our group so we know what what to work on next time. The biggest positive of our group was how well we worked together. We worked around each others schedules and we divided up the work evenly. We discussed every step of the process through texts, emails, and facebook. I hope that we get to stay in the same group for future projects because we have a great group dynamic. As far as the deltas, I think our group got too overwhelmed too quickly. Looking back, I think that if we were able to talk to Aaron earlier than saturday, then maybe we could have read the google api and proceeded to use ipython instead of R. Since we had midterms coming up, our group wanted to finish the project as early as possible and we did. However, I think we missed out on learning ipython in the process. I feel like the groups who used ipython for this project have a slight advantage for next time. Our group needs to start reading about ipython now so we can be prepared. Overall, I am glad to be done with this first project and I hope to do better next time!
