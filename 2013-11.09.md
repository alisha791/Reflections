######Week 10:

The class as a whole made a lot of progress this week and I'm glad that I have a better understanding of our "minimum viable product" for December 12th. Prior to Tuesday, I was overwhelmed with numerous github emails about our expectations for the following class. Everyone, including myself, seemed to be confused about what direction we were headed even though I attended OH that Saturday so I was not expecting such an organized presentation on Tuesday. I was impressed by how the presenters managed to organize ideas and give the class a better idea about how the subgroups are going to work together for the rest of the semester. The analyzers, who are responsible for the bulk of the paper, discussed how they are working to produce the ETAS and MDA model. It was nice to see that there is now a strong possibility that we will accmplish our goal by December 12th. At the same time, this week was probably the most challenging for me personally because I feel like I have not been able to contribute as much as I would have liked to. As a data curator, I am responsible for organizing the earthquake data into a usuable format for the analyzers. Although this is an important task, it also is a task meant for a computer programmer and not a statistician. We do not perform analysis or look at how to fit models on the data so I'm afraid that by the end of this semester I will not even understand how the final product was produced. In addition, since I only have computer programming experience in R and MATLAB, curating the data in ipython notebook was a challenge for me. I wrote code to compile various csv files together but it turned out that there was actually a better way to do this. I appreciate having computer science majors in our group but it was also disappointing to know that I was not able to contribute to the final product. Nonetheless, I did learn more python in the process of coding, which is one of my individual SMART goals for this class. In the end, only 1 or 2 people out of our 11 person group wrote the final data curation code. The final code is definitely not something that I could have wrote myself but I can understand it and its functionality.
  
Since the data curator's job is complete for now, the presenters suggested that we all split up and join other groups. On Thursday, the data curators discussed how we would split up and we decided that a subset of us would remain together and form a writing team responsible for 'curating' the information from the other groups in an organized paper. Even though Aaron said that we do not have to have a paper by December 12th, we thought it would be more beneficial to have one than not. The rest of the data curators decided to split up and join other groups. I was unsure what I wanted to do but I knew that my skill set would be best utilized in the writing team so I decided to stay there. However, since the presenters informed me that the "heart" visualizer team needed a data curator, I joined their group. I was a little frustrated that I was not able to stay in the writing team but I hope that I will be able to make contributions to the heart team. My only worry is that they have already been working together and I do not want to hold them back. 
  
By the end of class on Thursday, I contacted the heart team but I still have not received a response! I need to have a group to have something to work on so I am a little worried. In the meantime, I am planning on reading the Luen paper in depth and learning more python. I may start working with the writing team if I do not get a response before Monday. I have midterms next week and a busy weekend but I am going to try to attend the python workshop tomorrow. I'm looking forward to seeing how much we accomplish this upcoming week.
