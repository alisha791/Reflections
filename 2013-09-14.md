Week 2:


  Although we were not able to accomplish our original goals this week, we discussed what we need to change in the future which I think was very helpful. On Thursday, we spent the entire class talking about things that both the instructors and students need to change. I hope that these changes are made so that the following weeks will be more productive. It would be very helpful to have a road map for this class so students know what to expect every week and can do outside reading about the different subjects. I feel like I need to put more time into learning about these software on my own so I can contribute more to the class. Overall, I really like the low-stress and collaborative feel of this class and I hope to start programming soon!
