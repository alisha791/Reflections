Week 2:


1) This week was challenging because I had trouble using vagrant to run iphython notebook. I am still having trouble remembering all the different commands and software we used. I felt like I was just typing in the commands and downloading the software the instructors told me to without knowing the purpose of what I was doing. In the end, although I was successfully able to create 'project 1' inside of virtual machine, this was not the case for the entire class. Everyone is using slightly different computer systems and it has been difficult to get everyone on the same page. These challenges are to be expected in a class of this size but I hope that in the future we are able to resolve these problems quickly. I think it was very beneficial that we spent the entire class on Thursday providing feedback and discussing changes that need to be made.  

2) I had an 'Aha' moment this week when another student pointed out that a command wasn't working because I had named my file differently that that of the instructors. I thought I forgot to install something but in reality, I was making a simple spelling mistake. This 'Aha' moment made me realize just how important the small details are when it comes to collaborative data science. Thursday's feedback session was also a big 'Aha' moment. Before Thursday, I felt like I was the only one lost in the class. I knew that changes needed to be made in the class but I didn't know exactly what changes would be beneficial. Now I feel more confident because the instructors are going to give us a roadmap of what to expect and therefore I can be more prepared for class. 

3) I would not change anything about this week. On Tuesday I followed the instructors instruction on how to download softare and on Thursday I contributed to my groups discussion about the plus's and delta's for this class. If I had known that we were going to use vagrant on Tuesday, then I wish I had read about that software before coming to class. I am looking forward to hearing the guest speakers next week and I hope they will give me more insight into collaborative data science. Now that we will be given a roadmap of what to expect in the class, my personal goal is to spend outside time reading about the different software we will be using. Overall, I really like the low-stress and collaborative feel of this class and I hope to start programming soon!
