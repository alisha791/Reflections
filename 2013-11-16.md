####Week 11

This was one of the less stressful weeks of the semester. With Aaron gone, the class focused on getting organized and working within our individual subgroups. Last Thursday, the data curators split up into different groups because data curation, for the most part, is complete. I joined the heart group but since I didnt know any of the members, I had to contact them through gitHUb. I made several attempts to contact them but I didn't get a reply so I was a little confused about what I should work on. Eventually I was able to contact the heart group in class and we are planning on meeting today to make SMART goals for the final few weeks. As visualizers, we need most of our data from the analyzers but I'm hoping we will be able to write pseudo-code. None of the members in my team have strong programming skills so I think that we will need to talk to other visualizer teams to get help. So far the heart team has trouble getting started so I am hoping that as I data curator I will be able to contribute to the group's understanding of the project and how we should approach the data. When Aaron comes back, I think it would be benefical for us to go to office hours and discuss our SMART goals. 

My individual SMART goals for this class are to learn more about python and have a better understanding of the Luen paper and the statistics involved. I have been working towards these goals by reading about python commands and working in ipython notebook. I have a firmer grasp on the Luen paper since the GSI's have been giving informative presentations and explaining the math behind Luen's model. I can't believe the semester is almost over and how much progress this class has made in really only the last 4 weeks. In the remaining weeks, I plan on working closely with the heart team to create meaningful graphs that illustrate the earthquake data and our model.
