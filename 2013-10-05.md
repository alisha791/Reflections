Week 5:

Tuesday's Class:

On Tuesday, the GSI's and instructors split the class into vertical and horizonal groups. There are 4 people in each vertical group and 11 people in each horizontal group. I was assigned the position of curator so I was responsible for cleaning up the google questionaire data. After Tuesday's class, I felt very confused about the homework assignment because I felt like the instructions were very ambiguous. In addition, I didn't know my verical group members yet and as the curator I knew I had the first step in the assignment's process. The analyzer of our group was great in taking the initiative to contact everyone in the group by Tuesday night and setting up a time to meet. We planned to meet on Thursday after class and I wanted to be done with the data cleaning portion by then. However, when I looked at the instructions for the assignment on gitHub, I realized that we needed to open the google doc using virtual machine and then use python to code. After many failed attempts, I could get the google doc to open so I made the decision to download the doc as a csv file and use R. I knew I was responsible for getting the group started and I didnt want to cause our group to fall behind and have nothing to present next Tuesday. I wanted to clean up the data efficiently and I felt like I would not be able to do that using python. On Thursday, I talked to my group and the instructor about using R and we all agreed that it was the best action to take as all of us are unfamiliar with python language. The fact that the instructor told us that we made the right decision in using R was definitely an "Aha" moment for our group and I. We realized that we just needed to justify our decisions and we felt confident about the decision to use R. After class on Thursday, our group met to discuss what columns of the questionaire we wanted to look at and how we wanted to analyze our data. We discussed different correlations that might exist and that we could look at. I felt much less stressed out after talking to my group. Everyone was sharing great ideas and I am looking forward to seeing the finished product. We are still not finished working on on the project but we are almost there. By Saturday we are hoping to be done with the visualization component of the project and discuss what needs to go into the presentation that day. So far I do not have any regrets in how we aproached this homework assignment but I do wish that I spent some time last week reading about python so that maybe I could have done the project in python like the instructors asked. At first I was very frustated by the fact that the instructors were being so ambiguaous about the assignment but I realize that this assignment's goal is probably not to look at the data itself, but how to work collaboratively and make smart, quick desisions. 

Thursday's Class:

On Thursday, I thought we would spend class time working with our groups on the homework assignment. Instead, Professor Starks came in to present which was great. He spoke about the current models that are used to predict earthquakes and the innaccurate assumptions upon which they rely. I had no idea just how flawed the current ways that people predict earthquakes are. If someone were to tell me that earthquake researchers combine 3 different stochastic models to get a earthquake probability, I would think that was impressive. However, Professor Stark showed us that there are many assumptions that people make all the time that just aren't true. I thought it was interesting to see how statisticians can have such different opinions about what is an accurate model and what isn't. His presentation made me exctited to start looking at the earthquake data to see if we could really create a model that actually accurately predicts earthquakes.
