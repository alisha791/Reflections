###Week 13:

I really enjoyed Fernando's presentation today. I almost wish that he gave this presentation at the begining of the semester as an introduction to ipython notebook. I know that I would have been a lot more motivated to use ipython than R to complete the first few homework assignments. It was really interesting to see how he used ipython directly as his presentation tool. Surprisingly, today was the first time I really saw how ipython notebook faciliates reproducible data science. After this class ends, I would still like to learn more about ipython notebook since it has so many applications that I had no idea about. 

Although we don't have class until next Tuesday, I plan on spending some time thinking about this class as we only have a couple weeks left until December 12. It was helpful that the Quakers presented today because my group has been working on understanding and improving their graphs and I now have a better understanding of what their graphs are trying to show. It was also helpful that Professor Stark was present because he asked important questions about where we are in the process and how we are thinking about the earthquake models. At this point, it seems unlikely that we will have positive results by December 12 but I dont think we should give up. Whatever our end result ends up being, I think it will be amazing to be able to present what we have been working on to an outside audience.
