Week 1  
  
  This week was a bit challenging for me because I had trouble installing Adium and Virtual Machine. The installation instructions were a bit unclear to me and I had unknowingly skipped a whole set of instructions that were not in the homework 1 repository. However, what's great about this class is that everyone is so willing to help. On Tuesday, a student walked me through how to install Adium and on Thursday, a GSI helped me install the Virtual Machine box properly. We have not done any programming so far in the class but after this week, I can say that I finally know how to properly install Adium and Virtual Machine. I know that having the proper tools is essential in collaborative data science so I feel like this was a successful week. However, I still don't fully understand how GitHub works and I definitely don't know all the GitHub terminology. I am very new to this software and I plan on doing some independent reading about GitHub so I'll feel more comfortable using it.
	To be more efficient next week, I plan on doing some at home reading about GitHub and Virtual Machine and make sure to read through any materials that have been posted on bspace. My advise to other students would be to do the same. I like how in today's class, 9/5, we went through commands together and made sure everyone was on the same page before moving on. Unfortunately, we encountered some technological setbacks that prevented us from moving onto ipython notebook but I hope we can resolve these problems soon and start getting into more interesting topics.
