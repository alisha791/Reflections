####Week 14

It is hard to believe that we have just finished our last week of class and that the data science fair is next Thursday! As the data science fair is fast approaching, Professor Stark was in class on both Tuesday and Thursday. He was very critical which was helpful because it helped the class think about how the earthquake model should be created. The Quakers made several presentations and have actually created a model that has a slightly lower area under the curve value than Luen's model. Although we may not be able to address all of Professor Stark's concerns by next Thursday, I think that it amazing that the class was able to create a working model that is distinct from Luen's. On Thursday, much of class time was spent reflecting on our experiences in the class and discussing how we are going to organize everything by next Thursday. It is admirable how several students have almost taken on the role of an instructor to get the class organized and ready by next Thursday. Every group in the class has been assigned a different aspect of the presentation on Thursday. My group has already been working on improving the code of other groups so we decided to be part of the reproducibilty team. A subset of our group, including myself, decided to work on the video aspect of the presentation.

Looking back on my experiences in this class, there have definitely been many ups and downs. I came into this class expecting to learn about different programming tools, having exams, and maybe a final project. I quickly realized that this was going to be a very unique class and I had no idea how I would be evaluated. I was frustrated many times throughout the semester because I didn't even know what my expectations were. The first few weeks of class were spent downloading software without knowing why and discussing "reproducibility", again without knowing why. The next few weeks were spent completing homework assignments using programming software that most of the students in the class didn't have any previous exposure to. There was a lot of self learning and leaning on fellow group members during this time. I got to know my group members really well and although there was a lot of frustration, I probably learned the most technically during this part of the class. The last third of class was spent looking at earthquake data and improving upon Luen's model for earthquake prediction. I was the most condused during this period of the class because we had to work in large groups of 11 and it was very difficult for me to keep in contact with everyone. I also had to switch from being a data curator which was frustrating because I had to get to know my group members all over again. However, in the end, I have genuinely enjoyed working with the people in every one of my groups. I think that the non-competitive nature of this class, has made collaboration easy in this class. It was refreshing to be in this type of class at Berkeley and I don't think I have ever got to know my group members as well as I have in this class. 

Although I came into this class hoping to learn about different programming software, stat 157 has taught me so much about the real world than I could have imagined. I have learned how to collaborate, communicate, and divide up tasks with a group. I have learned how to make executive decisions about a project when the instructions are unclear. Along the way, I have leaned so much about git, python, and virtual machine, even though I never felt like I was directly taught how to use these software in class.
