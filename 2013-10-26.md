###Week 8

Since we do not have a project due next Tuesday, this week was less stressful and more organized than previous weeks. On Tuesday, we did a code review which ran a lot smoother than last time. After doing the last project, my group and I are a lot more comfortable using git commands and ipython notebook. This made reproducing other groups code very easy. Also, this time everyone used ipython noteboook so everyone's code was reproducible with maybe just a few minor code smells. I was very impressed by how other groups visualized the earthquake data. One group made a color gradient for the magnitude of earthquakes while another group plotted the earthquakes nicely on a world map that zooms in on the region of interest. It's great that I am able to look at these groups code to see what they did and learn more about ipython. Although our groups visualization was not as pretty, it was reproducible and I think it turned out great given that no one in our group has a CS background or experience with python. At the end of class on Tuesday, Aaron also tried to teach us some ipython functions but this was hard for me to follow and I wish that the information could be posted online. We also discussed our upcoming project which is to create an earthquake model using Professor Stark's information from his slides. I do not completely understand the information he has on his slides so I plan on reviewing that information.

On Thursday, we spent sometime in class discussing grades. I'm really glad that we now have a better understanding of how we will be graded but at the same time I am unhappy with the fact that our previous grades up until now have been "erased". My group and I spent a lot of time in office hours and on our project so I feel like it's unfair that all this work will go unnoticed. I hope that by the end of the semester, everyone's contributiona and effort will be accurately measured. With the new sign in sheet I do think that attendence will increase and hopefully we can get more done each class period. During the next part of class, everyone was divided into their horizontal groups to discuss the Earthquake project and the idea of eventually publishing a paper. As a data curator, my job is to gather all the relevant data and condense it into a usuable format. By this upcoming Tuesday, our group should have something to show but so far I am unsure of how to coordinate everything. I think that an 11 person group is too big to get anything accomplished. I also do not see the point of our vertical groups anymore since we are all working one one big project and each horizontal group is working on one aspect of the big project. I hope that my horizontal group will be able to have something ready on Tuesday to show the rest of the class so that the other groups can start analyzing and visualizing the data.
