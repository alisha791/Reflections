Week 4:

Although I feel like we discussed some important topics this week, I do not think that we utilized our time most efficiently. I think that our discussion on Tuesday about when reflections should be due took up an unnecessary amout of time. Deadlines should be set by instructors and students should be held accountable to meet those deadlines. Furthermore, reflections are not very time-consuming and are our only weekly homework assignment for this class. I was very surprised and disappointed by the fact that we spent almost the entire class discussing the due date. In the end, the due date was not changed and the real question about how to turn in reflections was never answered. I, like many other students, are not sure about whether we are turning in our reflections properly. Should I do a pull request? Are my reflections being read? I wish that the instructors just spent 10 min physically showing us the proper way to turn in reflections on the computer instead of discussing the due date for over an hour. At the same time, I am very grateful that the instructors are so open to feedback and are even willing to change deadlines. However, I think that this is also slowing us down and I think that both students and instructors would benefit from a stricter schedule. Every student has differnt ideas about what should be done but it is near impossible to satisfy everyone. The only thing that the entire class has agreed upon is the need for a syllabus. I hope that the instructors work on creating a syllabus/road map soon. I believe that having a guide will significantly improve the efficiency of this class and would definitely help the class run a lot smoother. In addition, I think that we have given enough feedback to the instructors as a group and think that it is time to start programming. Individual feedback can always be given through these weekly reflections!

At the end of Tuesday's class, I was happy that most of the class, including myself, were able to access iphython notebook. The GSI's were great in finally figuring out how to make iphython work on almost everyone's individual operating system. Unfortunately, although this class emphasizes reproducibility, I doubt that I could successfuly reproduce what the GSI's did to make iphython work on my computer, on someone else's computer. 

Thursday's entire class was spent talking about reproducibility. It turned out to be an informative class even though I initially hoped we would start working with ipython notebook. Reproducibilty is the core subject of this class but as undergraduates without extensive research experience, it is difficult to get completely engaged in the subject. In addition, I think it is hard to talk about reproducibility when we have not even looked at any real data or created any programs. The instructors may say that we must address reproducibility before we program but I think it makes more sense to discuss reproducibility while we program. We discussed reproducibility before installing several pieces of software but we did not address reproducibility during the installation process and now I think most students would be unable to reproduce installing the various pieces of software. For this reason, I belive that reproducibility needs to be implented while we are programming, not before or after. I am definitely not against reproducibilty because if you want to be able to share your ideas on a large scale in the scientific world, your process must be reproducible. The only reason I am not particularly interested in reproducibility at the moment is because we have not worked on anything that we need to work on to make reproducible. I hope to start programming and learn more about the importance of reproducibilty in the process. I already see its necessary role since it has taken us many weeks to get ipython working for the whole class because of different operating systems. 

Overall, although this class has had a rough start, I am hopeful for the future. Honestly, right now I am more interested in learing about different programming tools but it would also be nice to have a firm grasp on reproducibilty by the end of this course. I can't wait to see how this class will evolve throughout the semester!
