###Week 12

These past few weeks the instructors have given us time to work in our individual subgroups. It has been nice to have in-class working sessions because it is not always easy for my whole group to find time to meet outside of class. Last week I made the switch from being a data curator to joining the visual heart group. I had trouble contacting it's members and figuring out where they were in the earthquake project. However, since last week, I feel like I have fully integrated into the heart group and have made important contributions to the group as well. Since most of our group members do not have a tremendous amount of programming experience, our group has focused more on improving other groups graphs and understanding the math behind Luen's model. For this reason, members from other groups who feel like they could make more contributions by focusing less on the programming aspects of this project, have joined our group. Our group now consists of 9 members, which is perhaps a bit too large but because we have made communication easy, having a group of this size is feasible. Our group not only uses google calendar to schedule office hours with Aaron, but has also created a facebook group where everyone can easily discuss their ideas. 

Last Saturday, 5 members from our group met at Cafe milano to discuss our SMART goals. We filled out out the google spreadsheet and discussed our individual evaluations that we turned in last week. This was a very helpful meeting because all of us were in the "land of confusion and worry" and needed direction. As visualizers, we thought that we had to create our own graphs distinct from the other visualizer groups graphs. We realized that ultimately, our entire class is working towards the same goal and that it would benefit the class goal more if we worked on improving the existing graphs. We felt it was important for us to undertake this task because right now the graphs would be hard for the average person to understand. We want to make the graphs as imformative, organized, and asthetically pleasing as possible. In addition, by trying to undertand Luen's paper, we are also better equipped to make changes to the graphs because we know what the graphs are trying to show. On Thursday, the Quakers, another vizualization group, came up to us and asked us if we could work on understanding the connection between their individual graphs and Luen's graphs. To do this, we need to fully understand the math behind Luen's model.

Our group dynamic has been great and it was nice to see how Jie and I, who were data curators before, were quickly able to make contributions to this new group. Everytime we come up with a new SMART goal, we make sure to divide the tasks among the members of our group so everyone has something to work on. It has been really beneficial because it forces us to stay on track and make sure we get everything done that we need to. It was nice to receive a personal email from Kristina to our group. I think it was reassuring that she also sees that the goals we have come up with our important to the overall goal. The email was also great because it showed us that the instructors really are listening to everyone's feedback, the positive and the negative. 

This week, I, along with some of the other group members worked on looking at the Quakers graphs and figuring out how we could improve them. Each of us had different issues running the code, indicating some reproducibility errors but we all the same general conclusions about how to improve the graphs. We made an outline of our ideas and then passed on this to other members of the group who are responsible for actually making these changes. Our group is going to office hours today to discuss our future SMART goals and just get some confirmation about whether what we have been working on is helpful. We want to make sure that we aren't doing duplicate work but actually contributing to the final project.  

In the coming weeks, I hope that we will continue to be as productive as we have been. I am a little worried about how much thanksgiving break will set us back. December 12 is almost here but I think we are on the right to reaching our ultimate goal. I'm also looking forward to presentations on Tuesday because right now I dont know what every group is working on and it would be helpful to have some idea about how all the subgroups are going to eventually contribute to a final earthquake project.
